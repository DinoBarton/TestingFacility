So I had this cheeky idea, what if instead of constantly connecting to wifis all the time why cant we just have a script constantly snif out wifi netowrks and connect to the automatically. 

Requirements:
    Must automatically connect to netowrks
    Must always connect to the strongest netowrk
    Must alert user if cannot find free network
    Must filter through ones that require setup e.g. login or acknowledgement (advanced for now)

Docs:

1. did a search with chatgpt, just taking a look.
2. using a bash script BIG UP LINUX!
3. 

PSUEDO CODE:
    search netowrks
    identify ones with out needing password
    order from highest strength to lowest
    choose highest
    If the order changes always choose highest
    If none alert user

4. Dang it, I dont know nothing about bash. I cant just have GPT here to do it for me I wont learn, and bruh thats kinda lame.
5. Ah i see learnt something here:
    say we want to make functions we do this
        variable() {
            dsajkdljsaljdlksa
        }
    
    and to make a loop we do:
        while true; do 
            ...
        done

    Oh and we close if statements with fi?!?!??!

6. AHH im getting this its just commands thats all.
7. lil confused theres stuff like, alert_user "LOL"
    but say alert_user is a function would it just do e.g. echo "$1" "LOL" ??
8. LOL i checked with chatGPT and it told me that it substitutes into th "$1" what a noob.
9. One thing i was interested about was the use of loops I was wondering if it wa just a list of commands then surely a loop like that wouldnt make sense, now I realise that it does make sens as its only repeating the commands and stuff. 
10. wow I ave learnt alot!
11. one thing i should do is learn this nmcli thing. 
12. I see its just a command for wifi all that, I wont go to deep, theres docs for this.
13. Going to test soon - Need to install linux first LOL
14. going to try it out with windows first

AGALE AGALE! no estoy un cachondeo jajaja
